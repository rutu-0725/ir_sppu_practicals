# BE_AIDS_IR_Practicals

This repository contains Information Retrieval (IR) practicals for the Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI & DS) program. It includes projects and exercises that cover key IR concepts, algorithms, and applications.

## Repository Structure

- **Datasets**: Contains data files used in various practicals.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code implementations and explanations.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for core IR techniques and experiments.
- **Reports**: Documentation and reports for each practical, summarizing findings and observations.

## Practicals

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
2. **Vector Space Model**: Implementing and testing vector space models for document similarity.
3. **Boolean Retrieval**: Building a boolean retrieval model for simple search.
4. **TF-IDF**: Calculating term frequency-inverse document frequency for document ranking.
5. **PageRank Algorithm**: Simulating PageRank for ranking web pages.
6. **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)**: Applying LSA for dimensionality reduction in text data.
7. **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculating precision, recall, and F1-score for IR models.
